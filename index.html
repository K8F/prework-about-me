      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a technical writer at Autodesk. I've written extensively about security and compliance and have recently moved into the world of APIs. When I'm not writing, you'll find me playing clarinet with the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Southeast Missouri, also known as the "Bootheel." Google the state if you want to know why.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to read and write and analyze movies and TV. I'm more of a beer snob than a wine snob, but I'll drink either. I've been playing clarinet close to 20 years. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One day I'd like to teach writing and literacy skills to adults.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Oakland, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I write documentation for developers. I want to better understand how they think. What better way than to become a developer myself?</p>
